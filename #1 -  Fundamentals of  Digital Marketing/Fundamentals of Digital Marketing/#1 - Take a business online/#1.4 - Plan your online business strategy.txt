Introduction
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From identifying your goals to knowing how to track your progress, this topic will show you how to put your best foot forward when creating a digital business strategy. Learn how to stand apart from the competition and how to impress customers at every point of their experience.



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. The benefits of an online strategy
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q. An online business strategy can boost your chances of digital success, helping you to define clear goals and focus your online activity. In this lesson, we'll explore:
	- how an online business can benefit from a business strategy
	- best practices when creating a business strategy
	- examples of common goals and popular strategies to achieve them.

A. Sam will find it easier to put together his online strategy once he’s figured out the company's goals, written a mission statement and identified the company's USP.

Once his strategy is in place, he can launch his website, develop a targeted digital marketing campaign, and establish a client base.

2. Taking a business online
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q. When taking a business online, understanding how customers browse on the web is an important factor in ensuring your online efforts are rewarded. In this lesson, we will explore:
	- customer behaviours online, and how these overlap with offline behaviours
	- the "See, Think, Do, Care" framework, and how to use this to help understand the online customer journey
	- how to group your audiences using audience segmentation.

A. Although Omar has a successful market stall, his goal is to develop his online business- so focusing only on his offline marketing skills wouldn't help.

Selling at a cheaper price on the website could be a risky decision so early on. While some retailers do engage in this practice, others price match. Given that e-commerce is new to Omar, it would be less risky to keep the online and offline pricing the same to start.

Identifying all audiences will allow him to decide when he should engage with them, and what he should talk about - helping to increase his chance of success online.

Lastly, while paid online advertising might be an effective channel, Omar should consider all possible options and see which fits his business needs best.

3. Understanding customer behaviour
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q. Create the best possible online experience for customers by understanding how to make the most of the moments when they interact with a brand. In this lesson, we'll explore:
	- what customer touchpoints are
	- how to map common online customer journeys
	- how to identify customer touchpoints that generate business goals.

A. The customers have been experiencing difficulty in navigating the website, so Holly and her team should look at how they can improve the website's design and page layout.

Customers also found contact information difficult to locate. Holly can make this information easier to find by creating a clear 'Contact Us' page, and by including contact details in the footer of every page. She can also include it in her email marketing campaigns, which will allow customers to contact the business without having to visit the website.

4. How to stand out from the competition
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q. Understanding the competition is a key component of your online strategy, enabling you to position a business correctly in the marketplace. In this lesson, we'll explore:
	- how to identify what makes a business stand out in a busy marketplace
	- why Unique Selling Points (USPs) are important and how to construct them
	- online tools available to help you research the competition.

A. Ensuring Bobbi’s company has a strong USP could help it attract new customers online. Being unique is an effective way to stand out in an already crowded marketplace.

Bobbi could also look at what her competitors are doing to find out what's working well for them, and what isn’t. This would provide her with a broader market view, and would highlight potential opportunities which she could use to formulate a strategy for her own company's growth.

By conducting a SWOT analysis, she can identify opportunities that will allow the business to grow - as well as highlight weaknesses she could resolve.

5. Using goals to improve business performance
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q. When marketing your business online, it's important to use the data and metrics available to evaluate how your online activities are performing. In this lesson, we'll explore:
	- why setting goals and KPIs is so important to online businesses
	- how to construct a KPI using the SMART framework
	- how to analyse data gathered to help improve online marketing efforts.

A. The KPIs you've selected are:
	- Specific
	- Measurable
	- Attainable
	- Relevant
	- Time bound
	
Think about how you could improve the remaining two KPIs that were not quite right. Do they need to be more specific or time bound?
