Introduction
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

By incorporating a mix of both display and search engine advertising, you’ll be able to maximise your online visibility. Learn about the benefits of display and search ads, how they differ and how to find and target the right audience, so that you have the skills to correctly structure your ad campaigns.

1.  What is display advertising?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q. Display advertising allows businesses to reach specific groups of people on specific websites with their messages. In this lesson, we'll look at:
    - what display advertising is
    - how it works
    - the goals it can help you reach.

A. A film production agency might be able to help with the creation of the ads if they specialise in digital formats, but they are likely to be costly and won’t sell ad space themselves.

Colin also shouldn't look for an online ad space in offline business directories.

A forum for movie fans is a good idea – there are probably many people there that could be interested in visiting Colin's blog.

Alternatively, if he doesn’t know where he wants to post yet, he could contact a network that matches businesses with ad spaces.

2. Search advertising vs. display advertising
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q. Search engine marketing and display advertising can both help you find customers and grow your business, but they work differently. Here, we'll compare the two, explaining:
    - how they both work
    - where the different ads appear
    - what those advertisements look like.

A. Colin’s search ad would only show up when people are searching for keywords on a search engine. This is known as search engine marketing (SEM).

Search ads are text based so they’re an ideal way to put content in front of people who already have an interest in a specific subject. In this case, film fans.

Once a person moves away from a search engine, search ads can no longer target them. This is where display ads come in. These can appear on any website where paid advertising space is available.

As display ads can contain graphics, audio and even video, they can be a lot more engaging. If Colin puts a display ad on a cinema listings page, he can draw in cinema-goers who may not otherwise search for his website.

3. The ins and outs of display advertising
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q. Ready to create a display advertising campaign? First you've got to understand how to use all the different components of display, including:
    - how to find and target the right audience
    - how to create different kinds of adverts
    - how to organise your display campaigns.

A. The best sites to advertise on are the ones where the target audience is likely to be visiting. That way, Colin knows his ads will be seen by people who are likely to be interested in his site.

Colin could also draw in more visitors by putting the ads in the cinema listings page on Fridays and Saturdays when a lot of people are going to the cinema. He could even alter the message according to the time and location.

Technically, the more locations Colin can place his ad, the more people he can pull in. The news site or his friend's blog might still get him a few hits, but the less targeted audience means he won’t get as many as he would from a more relevant site, like the filmography page.
