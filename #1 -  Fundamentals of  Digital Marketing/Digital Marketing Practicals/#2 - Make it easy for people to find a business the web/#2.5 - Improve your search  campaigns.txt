1. Achieve relevance with good structure
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use a spreadsheet, a document, or even pen and paper to create 3–4 ad groups for the Wedding Photography and Baby Photography campaigns that you saw during the lesson. Need a hint to get started? Think about the types of products that might belong to these two categories.

2. Get the most from your keywords
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use one of the research tools linked on the right. See if you can find five keywords that are relevant to your business. Then, see if you can find three irrelevant keywords that you can use as negative keywords.

3. Fine-tune with keyword match types
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use one of the research tools linked on the right to see how your estimated traffic and costs change if you restrict the keyword match types from broad to phrase or exact. Use the tool to help find the right balance between relevance and traffic. Think of it as the story of Goldilocks: not too hot, not too cold, just right.

4. How to know what's working and what isn't
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Review your website and brainstorm at least one conversion that you want to track. Then, search for “conversion tracking” tools that are offered by the search engine marketing service you’re using, like Google or Bing.
