1. Introduction to search engine marketing (SEM)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do a search for a product or service you're interested in buying. Take a look at the paid ads that appear - who do they seem to be targeting? Are they similar to what you searched for?



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. The SEM auction
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Search for a handful of keywords relevant to your business. What do you notice about the advertisers for these keywords? Which ads appear at the top of the page? Which ads appear lower? Can you see a correlation between relevance and ad position? Jot down your observations for future reference.




------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. What makes a good keyword
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Make a list of keywords you think are relevant to your business. Now, have a look at them with keyword research tools like Google Keyword Planner. How much traffic can you expect? What’s the estimated cost? Can you find other keywords you hadn’t thought of?

4. Make your ads stand out
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Does your business have any offers or promotions that you can use in your adverts? Brainstorm a few calls to action that will help potential customers understand what they should do when they reach your website.
