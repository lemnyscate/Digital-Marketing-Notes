1. Making your web pages search friendly
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do a search for one of the products or services you offer. Take a look at the results with a close eye on how other businesses optimise title tags and meta descriptions.




------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. How other websites can work for you
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Visit a social media page of a company you admire. What kind of information are they sharing? What type of content gets the best response from customers? Think about this as you create your own content strategy.




------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Cross borders with SEO
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Find three companies in your industry or business niche that target other languages or countries. How do you feel about their localisation approaches? Do they translate all content on the pages? Customise content such as currencies and navigation? Which options do you prefer for your internationalisation plan?
