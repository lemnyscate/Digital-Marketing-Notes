1. Your online goals
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Whether you've got an online presence already or not, do some thinking and write down the three biggest goals you want to achieve by getting more involved in digital.

2. Building your online presence
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Create an inventory – or a wish list – for your digital presence. What items are you already using? What would you like to add? Jotting down your ideas is the first step towards developing a digital plan.

3. Marketing your online presence
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write down the ways you attract visitors now, and how you’d like to find them in the future. Then for each, list the types of customer you want to target, and ideas for the advertising messages you’d like to show.

4. Analyse and adapt
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write down the digital goals you believe you can accomplish within six months. Next to each goal, estimate the costs, time and resources you'll need to achieve them. Then, ask yourself: are you dependent on any one technology? That could be a sign that you could be more flexible.
