1. Choosing your online presence
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write down all the places your business currently “lives” online, from listings, to social media sites, to your own website, if you have one. Now, write a wish list of options you’d like to include in the future. Next to each, jot down ideas about what you might include there, like content and functionality. How can you encourage customers to interact with you online?




------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. How websites work
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Every website with a domain name has a corresponding numerical identifier called an IP address. Want to see it in action? Open a web browser and enter this string of numbers in the address bar: 172.217.16.195

What do you see?




------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Key website ingredients
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Visit the websites you look at regularly and create a list of things you'd like to include on your own site. Pay close attention to how the information is organised on these sites, and where the information appears on the web pages.




------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Websites and your business goals
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Make a list of some of your best customers whom you might be able to call on to share a testimonial or a story about how you've helped them. Perhaps you can add a reviews or testimonials section to your website!




------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Make your website easy to use
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Make a list of things you’d like people to do on your website, like find your phone number, fill out a contact form or watch a video. Then, ask a friend or relative (who hasn’t seen your website) to try to accomplish those tasks. If possible, watch them as they navigate your site. Can they do it? Are some areas of the site difficult to navigate? Can you find any places that might be improved?




------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Website design do’s and don’ts
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pick a few of your favourite websites and load them on different devices and browsers. How do they look? Do they take a long time to load or require additional software? Do their designs make it easy to find information?
