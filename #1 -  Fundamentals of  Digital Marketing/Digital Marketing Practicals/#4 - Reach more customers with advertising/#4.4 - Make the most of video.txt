1. The rise of online video
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do a search on YouTube for videos that are relevant to your business. Note the types of text ads and video ads that are presented. Make a list of ways your business could take advantage of these opportunities.




------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. How video fits into your online strategy
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write out your online marketing goals. How can you make use of videos to achieve those goals? Do you need to produce video content, or could you simply advertise on other relevant videos? Take some time to write your next steps into using video.




------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Creating video content within your budget
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Brainstorm three video ideas you could film using the same location and actors, say a series of video how-tos. Remember – you don’t have to produce a major motion picture! The most popular videos are relatively brief.




------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Sharing and promoting your videos
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Consider your current website pages and social media profiles. Create a list of pages and topics where adding videos might be useful and engaging for your target audience. If you have any video content already created, practise uploading to YouTube or another video sharing site and practise using the features, such as adding titles, tags, keywords and descriptions.




------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Advertising on video sharing sites
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Visit some of your favourite channels on YouTube. What types of advertising do you see? Which types best grab your attention?




------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Measuring video performance
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have a video channel on YouTube, Vimeo or another video sharing site, review the site’s analytics tools. How are your videos performing? Which of your videos are most popular? What’s the average length of time people watch your videos?
