1. Marketing to the locals
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using your favourite search engine, type in a term such as “bicycle shop near me”. Take note of the various features that we have reviewed in this lesson. Do you see bicycle shops that are near your physical location? Does the search result list reviews? An address? Directions?

2. The power of local directories
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Visit one of the major local directories, such as Google’s, Yahoo’s or Bing’s. Search for your business to see if it is already listed and follow the steps to claim your listing. If you have already claimed the listing, make sure it’s optimised so that your listings are consistent, current and are placed in proper categories.
