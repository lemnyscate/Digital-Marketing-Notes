1. Social media basics
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Explore some of the popular social media sites you think your customers use, like Facebook, Twitter or Google+. As you do, write down the kinds of posts you could make there. What would this audience find interesting, funny or valuable... and want to share?

2. The right social media sites for you
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Make a list of at least four social networks. Which category do you think each falls under: personal, content sharing or professional?

3. Setting your goals for social media
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Consider your social media goals. Are you trying to build awareness? Are you looking for a way to communicate more with your customers? If you had to choose one goal to start, what would it be? How can you begin to put it into motion?

4. Getting on social media
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Get your business signed up for a social media network. Think about your customers, and which social networks they might already be using. Then, open an account and start building your profile.
