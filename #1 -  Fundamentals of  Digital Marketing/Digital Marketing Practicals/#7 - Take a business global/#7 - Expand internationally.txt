1. Introduction to international marketing and export
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write down the countries you are interested in marketing your products and services to. Next, log in to your web analytics tool and review your geographic reports for the last six months. What are the top regions or countries? Are engagement or conversion metrics showing interest? This exercise can help determine if your business already has a certain level of interest from other countries, and can be one way to help prioritise the market you target first.



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Validating your new market
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Visit a tool such as the Google Global Market Finder (http://translate.google.com/globalmarketfinder/g/index.html). Enter a keyword you are interested in researching. Select your location and language, then filter by your target market. Do you see any countries that might be worth researching in more detail?



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Being understood abroad
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Make a list of the countries you want to target and note the languages spoken in each. Can you support the languages with your current or future translation plans? Before getting started, be sure you're able to properly support customers in other countries.



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Advertise across borders
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do some research into social media sites in the countries you're considering targeting. Do they have social networks unique to their region? Are Facebook and Twitter just as popular there?



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. The support systems you will need
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Go online and research business agencies and customs laws for your target markets. Call or visit your government taxation and business office to gain an understanding of your own country's export rules. Put together a list of your discoveries and then consult with a legal or governmental expert.



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Helping customers abroad buy your products
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using a search engine, research the top payment methods in your target markets. If you're not currently set up to accept this payment type, investigate adding it to your payment options.



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Delivering to customers across the globe
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Explore the websites of the top shipping companies that serve your target markets and compare prices and cross-border services. Be sure to take into account your packaging sizes and any extra packaging requirements that may impact costs. Are there any savings when you compare companies? Does the company website note any additional services for shipping to your target country? Following your research, factor these estimates into your expansion costs.
