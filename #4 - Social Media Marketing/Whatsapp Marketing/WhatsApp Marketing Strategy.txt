4 WhatsApp Marketing Tips
-------------------------------
1. Create broadcast lists
2. Use group chats
3. Employ WhatsApp statuses
4. Craft a product catalog


Notes:
1. Include a click-to-chat link into your promotional emails
2. If you send a PDF file, make sure the size is small enough for it to be downloaded even via 3G. 10 megabytes or more is a big no-no.
3. Choose the best image size for your WhatsApp marketing posts. The optimal WhatsApp post image size is 800×800 px. For a profile image, it’s 500×500 px.
